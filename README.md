# 3D printing
why and what is 3Dprinting exactly?

firstly what is 3Dprinting:

3D printing (also known as additive manufacturing) is a process of making three dimensional objects from a digital file (ussually step, stl, obj and 3mf).
The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced cross-section of the object.

now why 3Dprinting:

well 3Dprinting can be used in all kinds of markets (industry, at home, schools and more) it has many applications from making prototypes of a product to printing a replacement part that broke in your home or even creating completely custom decorations for you home. this has many pros: first of all its usually cheaper to make prototypes and replacement parts yourself instead of ordering it from someone else, printed decorations can also make your home more special and unique.

# what types of 3D printing are there
1. fdm
2. sla
3. dlp
4. sls
5. there are much more types but these are the most known in the industry and at home

this guide will cover filament and resin 3D printers that are mostly used at home
1. 3D printer types that use filament: fdm
2. 3D printer types that use resin: sla and dlp
there are more but i will cover these types
